Transmitter test parameters.

## Field Documentation

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|txChannel|The RF channel which is used by the transmitter. Channel= \(F â€“ 2402\) / 2 \(Frequency Range : 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz\) See **[Receiver or transmitter channel](GUID-298CB8E1-A459-44B1-B58B-241C6CA43595.md)**.|
|testDataLen|The length of the payload of the test reference packets.|
|packetPayload|The contents of the payload of the test reference packets. See **[Transmitter payload type](GUID-80707A75-E945-4947-A4D5-1D9B33EA65BB.md)**.|
|phy|The PHY which is used by the transmitter. See **[Transmitter PHY type](GUID-9A5B3D5D-8E92-42ED-A7B4-C8E3768DC851.md)**.|
|transmitPowerLevel|The transmit power level which is used by the transmitter. Range: -127 to +20. \(Units: dBm\) Set to 0x7E to use the minimum transmit power level. Set to 0x7F to use the maximum transmit power level. If the parameter is set to a value other than 0x7E or 0x7F, then ble stack makes the requested change or makes closest change that it is capable of doing.|
