**Parent topic:**[Functions](GUID-AA412A66-C329-47A0-BB6A-362B8F7A62FE.md)

## C

```c
uint16_t GATTS_SendWriteResponse(uint16_t connHandle, GATTS_SendWriteRespParams_T *p_respParams);
```

## Description

GATT Server sends the write/prepare write/execute write response when this API is called. ResponseType in<br />**[GATTS\_SendWriteRespParams\_T](GUID-17FDF15A-DB58-4272-B92E-80C99AE7E11F.md)** indicates if the response is for write request, prepare write request<br />or execute write request.

Response to the GATT client is sent only if:

-   API initiates a Write response and a Write request was received by GATT server.

-   API initiates a Prepare Write response and a Prepare Write request was received by GATT server.

-   API initiates a Execute Write response and a Execution Write request was received by GATT server.


### Note

If the attribute setting of the attribute is set as **[SETTING\_MANUAL\_WRITE\_RSP](GUID-5D42802D-F3E3-40CC-943D-48F66577D896.md)**, the event **[GATTS\_EVT\_WRITE](GUID-20EFFBD2-7D3F-40CA-B85C-8FD3202D9933.md)**<br />with writeType is **[ATT\_WRITE\_REQ](GUID-0D831528-B2BE-42F9-9185-11F8F17DC4E1.md)** or **[ATT\_PREPARE\_WRITE\_REQ](GUID-0D831528-B2BE-42F9-9185-11F8F17DC4E1.md)** or **[ATT\_EXECUTE\_WRITE\_REQ](GUID-0D831528-B2BE-42F9-9185-11F8F17DC4E1.md)** will be sent to<br />application when GATT server receives these requests performing on this attribute.<br />In this case, application need to call this API to send write response or send error response if the request<br />is not permitted.

This API should be called to send the response only when event **[GATTS\_EVT\_WRITE](GUID-20EFFBD2-7D3F-40CA-B85C-8FD3202D9933.md)** is received.

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|\[in\] connHandle|Handle of the connection to send the write response.|
|\[in\] p\_respParams|Pointer to Write Response parameters. See **[GATTS\_SendWriteRespParams\_T](GUID-17FDF15A-DB58-4272-B92E-80C99AE7E11F.md)**.|

## Return values

|Return value|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|MBA\_RES\_SUCCESS|Successfully starts to send the write response.|
|MBA\_RES\_FAIL|Operation is not permitted as Write response/Prepare Write response/Execute Write response transmission was requested but write request/prepare write request/execute write request was not received.|
|MBA\_RES\_OOM|Internal memory allocation failure.|
|MBA\_RES\_INVALID\_PARA|Invalid parameters. Connection handle is not valid.|
