Once the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor of Transparent Uplink<br /> Characteristic is enabled by Client, Server can notify a Characteristic Value to Client<br /> without any Attribute Protocol layer acknowledgment though this attribute handle. That<br /> means Server could send burst of data to Client.

This CCCD should be enabled behind Uplink Credit Based Flow Control is enabled if Client<br /> would like to enable Uplink Credit Based Flow Control.
