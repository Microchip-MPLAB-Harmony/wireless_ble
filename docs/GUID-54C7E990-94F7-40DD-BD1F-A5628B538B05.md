# Firmware Update Request Operation

This procedure is used by OTA Client when it attempts to request OTA Server to authorize OTA<br /> firmware update process.

The OTA Client shall write the OTACP*Firmware Update Request*opcode to the OTACP<br /> with the image size and version information.

If the response to the *Firmware Update Request*opcode is not â€œSuccessâ€?, OTA Client<br /> shall consider OTA Server is not ready to execute OTA firmware update process or the<br /> relative parameters are not valid. OTA Client shall not issue the following<br /> operations.

If the response to the *Firmware Update Request*opcode is â€œSuccessâ€?, OTA Client<br /> shall get maximum fragmented image size and version information.

OTA Client shall cache the maximum fragmented image size for the image data<br /> transmission.
