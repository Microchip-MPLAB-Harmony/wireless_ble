# OTA Feature Discovery

This procedure shall be performed at least once before any other OTA Procedure is attempted. The<br /> OTA Client shall read the OTA Feature characteristic to determine the supported image<br /> types of the OTA Server in order to understand its capabilities.

Since all bits of this characteristic are static for the lifetime of the device \(i.e.,<br /> static permanently or until Service Changed is indicated\), the OTA Client may cache this<br /> value.
