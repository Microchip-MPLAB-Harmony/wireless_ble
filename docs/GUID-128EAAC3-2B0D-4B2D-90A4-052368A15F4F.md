# Fragmented\_Image Field

The fragmented image field is used for client to distribute firmware image to server. This field<br /> is only valid after client issues Firmware Update Start procedure. The maximum length of<br /> the Fragmented\_Image is decided by ATT\_MTU-3 and Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size field in the<br /> Response Code operation with Opcode 0x02.

If the length ATT\_MTU-3 is larger than Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size, then the max length of<br /> fragmented image shall be Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size.

If the length ATT\_MTU-3 is smaller than Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size, the client shall<br /> continue distribute the fragmented image until the total length equal to<br /> Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size.

Client shall wait the notification after the total length of sent fragmented images<br /> reaches to Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size before distributing the next fragmented images.

If the length of remaining fragmented image is less than Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size, then<br /> server shall send out the notification once the complete image is received.
