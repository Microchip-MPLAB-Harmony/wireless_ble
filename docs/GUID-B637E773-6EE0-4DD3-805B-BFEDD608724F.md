# Role/Service Relationships

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between service and profile roles.

A Transparent Server shall instantiate the Transparent Service [\[1\]](GUID-019FDCBD-1C56-4E89-B909-18844EDC6FD2.md#GUID-76D6ED9A-9D1F-476D-8220-D0D307741BD4). As shown above, a higher layer specification is required<br /> to provide additional requirements on top of TRS/TRSP that are specific to the need of<br /> the use case.

This profile defines two Transparent Channels \(Control Pipe and Data Pipe\) which can be<br /> established for higher application layer. Control Pipe is based on TCP characteristic<br /> attribute and Data Pipe is on TUD and TDD characteristic attributes.
