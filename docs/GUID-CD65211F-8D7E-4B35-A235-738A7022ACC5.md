# GATTS\_SendReadResponse

**Parent topic:**[Functions](GUID-AA412A66-C329-47A0-BB6A-362B8F7A62FE.md)

## C

```c
uint16_t GATTS_SendReadResponse(uint16_t connHandle, GATTS_SendReadRespParams_T *p_respParams);
```

## Description

GATT Server sends the read/read blob response when this API is called. responseType in<br />**[GATTS\_SendReadRespParams\_T](GUID-18303686-9DAC-430F-9AB6-DC4E4672C0F2.md)** indicates if the response is for read request or read blob request.

Response to the GATT client is sent only if:

-   API initiates a Read response and a Read request was received by GATT server.

-   API initiates a Read Blob response and a Read Blob request was received by GATT server.


### Note

If the attribute setting of the attribute is set as **[SETTING\_MANUAL\_READ\_RSP](GUID-5D42802D-F3E3-40CC-943D-48F66577D896.md)**, the event **[GATTS\_EVT\_READ](GUID-20EFFBD2-7D3F-40CA-B85C-8FD3202D9933.md)**<br />with readType is **[ATT\_READ\_REQ](GUID-0D831528-B2BE-42F9-9185-11F8F17DC4E1.md)** or **[ATT\_READ\_BLOB\_REQ](GUID-0D831528-B2BE-42F9-9185-11F8F17DC4E1.md)** will be sent to application when GATT server receives these<br />requests performing on this attribute. In this case, application need to call this API to send read response or<br />send error response if the request is not permitted.

This API should be called to send the response only when event **[GATTS\_EVT\_READ](GUID-20EFFBD2-7D3F-40CA-B85C-8FD3202D9933.md)** is received.

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|\[in\] connHandle|Handle of the connection to send the read response.|
|\[in\] p\_respParams|Pointer to Read Response parameters. See **[GATTS\_SendReadRespParams\_T](GUID-18303686-9DAC-430F-9AB6-DC4E4672C0F2.md)**.|

## Return values

|Return value|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|MBA\_RES\_SUCCESS|Successfully starts to send the read response.|
|MBA\_RES\_FAIL|Operation is not permitted as Read response/Read Blob response transmission was requested but read request/read blob request was not received.|
|MBA\_RES\_OOM|Internal memory allocation failure.|
|MBA\_RES\_INVALID\_PARA|Invalid parameters. Connection handle is not valid.|
