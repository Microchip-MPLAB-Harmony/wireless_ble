# GATTS\_SendReadResponse

**Parent topic:**[Functions](GUID-2C0CF1FA-B4E9-4999-9A93-45A167861CC8.md)

## C

```c
uint16_t GATTS_SendReadResponse(uint16_t connHandle, GATTS_SendReadRespParams_T *p_respParams);
```

## Description

GATT Server sends the read/read blob response when this API is called. responseType in<br />**[GATTS\_SendReadRespParams\_T](GUID-A87D0B6C-416A-4312-8B27-DEF9456BED70.md)** indicates if the response is for read request or read blob request.

Response to the GATT client is sent only if:

-   API initiates a Read response and a Read request was received by GATT server.

-   API initiates a Read Blob response and a Read Blob request was received by GATT server.


### Note

If the attribute setting of the attribute is set as **[SETTING\_MANUAL\_READ\_RSP](GUID-C17EB9D8-56A4-42DE-BB36-DBB302B23C5F.md)**, the event **[GATTS\_EVT\_READ](GUID-506F6039-E62F-4121-8CA8-2335BAF7EFB6.md)**<br />with readType is **[ATT\_READ\_REQ](GUID-0B817A0F-1AA2-42B6-B93A-41A883437B34.md)** or **[ATT\_READ\_BLOB\_REQ](GUID-0B817A0F-1AA2-42B6-B93A-41A883437B34.md)** will be sent to application when GATT server receives these<br />requests performing on this attribute. In this case, application need to call this API to send read response or<br />send error response if the request is not permitted.

This API should be called to send the response only when event **[GATTS\_EVT\_READ](GUID-506F6039-E62F-4121-8CA8-2335BAF7EFB6.md)** is received.

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|\[in\] connHandle|Handle of the connection to send the read response.|
|\[in\] p\_respParams|Pointer to Read Response parameters. See **[GATTS\_SendReadRespParams\_T](GUID-A87D0B6C-416A-4312-8B27-DEF9456BED70.md)**|

## Return values

|Return value|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|MBA\_RES\_SUCCESS|Successfully starts to send the read response.|
|MBA\_RES\_FAIL|Operation is not permitted as Read response/Read Blob response transmission was requested but read request/read blob request was not received.|
|MBA\_RES\_OOM|Internal memory allocation failure.|
|MBA\_RES\_INVALID\_PARA|Invalid parameters. Connection handle is not valid.|
