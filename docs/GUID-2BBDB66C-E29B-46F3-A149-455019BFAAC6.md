To enable the Control Pipe of Transparent Credit Based Profile, Client shall configure the<br /> Transparent Credit Based Control Point \(TRCBCP\) characteristic for notifications \(i.e.,<br /> via the *Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor*\). Then Client can send the<br /> control command to Server by writing a Characteristic Value to the TRCBCP<br /> Characteristic. And Server can reply the control command to Client by performing a<br /> Notification with a Characteristic Value to the TRCBCP Characteristic.
