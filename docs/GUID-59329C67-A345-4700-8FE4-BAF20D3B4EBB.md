# OTA Data Discovery

This procedure shall be used for fragmented image distribution.

The OTA Client shall configure the OTA Data characteristic for notifications \(i.e., via<br /> the *Client Characteristic Configuration*descriptor\) before writing data to OTA<br /> Data characteristic.

The OTA Client shall perform Firmware Update Start procedure first before writing data to<br /> OTA Data characteristic.

OTA Client shall expect to receive a notification from OTA Server after the total length<br /> of fragmented image has been distributed reaches to the Max\_Fragmented\_Image\_Size. OTA<br /> Client may set a timer to check this notification. If OTA Client doesnâ€™t receive the<br /> notification after this timer, OTA Client shall issue the Firmware Update Complete<br /> operation to stop the OTA firmware update process.
