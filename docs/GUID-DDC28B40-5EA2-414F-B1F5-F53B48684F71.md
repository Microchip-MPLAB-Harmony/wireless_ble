## Description

Extended advertising parameters.

## Field Documentation

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|advHandle|Identifies the advertising set whose parameters are being configured \(Range: 0 to 0xEF\). See **[Maximum advertising handle](GUID-9BD0F71C-2778-4604-8820-B15425EC4F06.md)**.|
|evtProperies|The type of advertising event that is being configured and its basic properties. The bit combination of **[Event properties of advertising report](GUID-59CE9059-FA55-4B29-B0C5-BE23701674FD.md)**.|
|priIntervalMin|Minimum advertising interval, \(Range: 0x20 to 0x1F4000\). \(Unit: 0.625ms\) See **[Extended primary advertising interval](GUID-88C91195-9CF6-452F-80B5-066D0556F970.md)**.|
|priIntervalMax|Maximum advertising interval, \(Range: 0x20 to 0x1F4000\). \(Unit: 0.625ms\) See **[Extended primary advertising interval](GUID-88C91195-9CF6-452F-80B5-066D0556F970.md)**.|
|priChannelMap|Advertising Channel Map. See **[Advertising channel](GUID-0F684465-9912-4A60-97A0-77569BD92858.md)** BLE\_GAP\_ADV\_CHANNEL\_ALL can't be used.|
|peerAddr|Remote bluetooth address and address type, see **[BLE\_GAP\_Addr\_T](GUID-39F32807-8A6F-4AC8-93AD-2AA3B1C75F46.md)**.|
|filterPolicy|Advertising filter policy. See **[Advertising filter policy](GUID-2A70B6D5-3938-4F3C-946E-56192384B633.md)**.|
|txPower|The maximum power level at which the advertising packets are to be transmitted on the advertising channels. Set to 0x7F if user has no perference of extended advertising TX power level. Level will be adjusted if value is not in range.|
|priPhy|Indicates the PHY on which the advertising packets are transmitted on the primary advertising channel. 2M can't be used for primary advertising. See **[PHY type](GUID-CA9CC4D6-A5FB-4168-9A8C-4A940EA04D2B.md)**.|
|secMaxSkip|The maximum number of advertising events that can be skipped before the AUX\_ADV\_IND can be sent.|
|secPhy|Indicates the PHY on which the advertising packets are transmitted on the secondary advertising channel. See **[PHY type](GUID-CA9CC4D6-A5FB-4168-9A8C-4A940EA04D2B.md)**.|
|sid|The value to be transmitted in the Advertising SID subfield of the ADI field of the Extended Header. See **[Advertising SID range](GUID-AD7FCE19-B510-4A42-B223-E0EAE1950AE8.md)**.|
|scanReqNotifiEnable|Indicates whether the notifications shall be sent upon the receipt of a scan request PDU. Set true to enable notification. Set false to disable notification.|
