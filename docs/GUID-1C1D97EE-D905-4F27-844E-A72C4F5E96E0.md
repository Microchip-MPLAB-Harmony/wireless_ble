# Transparent Control Point Procedure Requirements

Table 3.2 shows the opcode definition of TCP characteristic. Range from 0x04 to 0x13 and<br /> 0x16 to 0x1F are reserved for future used. Range from 0x20 to 0xFF are reserved for<br /> higher layer specification application.

|**Opcode**|**Description**|**Parameter**|**Response Code Triggered**|
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------|
|0x00|Response Code for received success opcode|Request opcode \(UINT8\), Response Parameters|No|
|0x01|Response Code for received opcode but not supported|Request opcode \(UINT8\)|No|
|0x02|Response Code for received opcode with invalid parameter|Request opcode \(UINT8\)|No|
|0x03|Response Code for received Op Code but operation Fail|Request opcode \(UINT8\)|No|
|0x04-0x13|Reserved|N/A|N/A|
|0x14|Downlink Credit Based Flow Control enable|None|Yes|
|0x15|Uplink Credit Based Flow Control enable|Credit Value \(UNIT8\)|No|
|0x16-0x1F|Reserved|N/A|N/A|
|0x20-0xFF|Reserved for higher layer specification|N/A|N/A|

Table 3.3 shows the of Response Parameters structure of Triggered Response Code.<br /> Recently, only 0x14 opcode Client role asserted may induce Response code.

<br />

|**Request Opcode**|**Response Parameters**|**Description**|
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
|Downlink Credit Based Flow Control enable \(0x14\)|MTU Value \(UNIT16\), Credit Value \(UNIT8\)|Server will send these Response Parameters by 0x00 opcode to give<br /> Credit Value|

<br />

Credit Value field is given Credit number that data receiver returned to transmitter. One<br /> credit returned means transmitter can send one ATT packet to receiver. The default<br /> Credit Value is zero before Credit Base Flow Control is enabled.

MTU Value field is ATT\_MTU value as the maximum size of any packet sent between a client<br /> and a server.
