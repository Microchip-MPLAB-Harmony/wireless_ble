# BLE_GAP_SetChannelMap

## C

```c
uint16_t BLE_GAP_SetChannelMap(uint8_t *p_map);
```

## Description

Set local channel map. If this API is not called then by default status of all 37 channels is treated unknown.

### Note

If this API is used, the application should send it within 10 seconds of knowing that the channel
classification has changed. The interval between two successive API calls should be at least one second.

BLE Stack uses this channel map as an input along with its own assessment of the channels.
This API is effective only for BLE Central role.

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|\[in\] p_map|5-byte channel map array containing 37 1-bit fields corresponding to 37 data channels. 0 indicates corresponding channel is bad and 1 indicates channel status is unknown.  The most significant bits are reserved and shall be set to 0.|

## Return values

|Return value|Description|
|:---|:---|
MBA_RES_SUCCESS|Successfully Set the channel map.|
MBA_RES_OOM|Internal memory allocation failure.|
MBA_RES_INVALID_PARA|Invalid parameters, if any of the bits Corresponding to advertising channels are set (3 Most significant bits of p_map[4]).|
