# GATT Sub-Procedure Requirements

Requirements in this section represent a minimum set of requirements for a server. Other<br /> GATT subâ€‘procedures may be used if supported by both the client and server.

Table 1.1 summarizes additional GATT sub-procedure requirements beyond those required by<br /> all GATT servers on Unenhanced Attribute Protocol \(ATT\) bearers.

Requirements in this section are defined as â€œMandatoryâ€? \(M\), â€œOptionalâ€? \(O\), â€œExcludedâ€?<br /> \(X\), and â€œConditionalâ€? \(C.*n*\). Conditional requirements \(C.*n*\) are listed<br /> directly below the table in which they appear.
