**Parent topic:**[Functions](GUID-2C0CF1FA-B4E9-4999-9A93-45A167861CC8.md)

## C

```c
uint16_t GATTS_SendWriteResponse(uint16_t connHandle, GATTS_SendWriteRespParams_T *p_respParams);
```

## Description

GATT Server sends the write/prepare write/execute write response when this API is called. ResponseType in<br />**[GATTS\_SendWriteRespParams\_T](GUID-DE4383BE-5A48-44EE-8955-214FCAA7E621.md)** indicates if the response is for write request, prepare write request<br />or execute write request.

Response to the GATT client is sent only if:

-   API initiates a Write response and a Write request was received by GATT server.

-   API initiates a Prepare Write response and a Prepare Write request was received by GATT server.

-   API initiates a Execute Write response and a Execution Write request was received by GATT server.


### Note

If the attribute setting of the attribute is set as **[SETTING\_MANUAL\_WRITE\_RSP](GUID-C17EB9D8-56A4-42DE-BB36-DBB302B23C5F.md)**, the event **[GATTS\_EVT\_WRITE](GUID-506F6039-E62F-4121-8CA8-2335BAF7EFB6.md)**<br />with writeType is **[ATT\_WRITE\_REQ](GUID-0B817A0F-1AA2-42B6-B93A-41A883437B34.md)** or **[ATT\_PREPARE\_WRITE\_REQ](GUID-0B817A0F-1AA2-42B6-B93A-41A883437B34.md)** or **[ATT\_EXECUTE\_WRITE\_REQ](GUID-0B817A0F-1AA2-42B6-B93A-41A883437B34.md)** will be sent to<br />application when GATT server receives these requests performing on this attribute.<br />In this case, application need to call this API to send write response or send error response if the request<br />is not permitted.

This API should be called to send the response only when event **[GATTS\_EVT\_WRITE](GUID-506F6039-E62F-4121-8CA8-2335BAF7EFB6.md)** is received.

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|\[in\] connHandle|Handle of the connection to send the write response.|

## Return values

|Return value|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|MBA\_RES\_SUCCESS|Successfully starts to send the write response.|
