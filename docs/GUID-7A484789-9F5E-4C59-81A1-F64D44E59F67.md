# BLE Memory Usage

**Static memory**

The size of BLE static memroy is 3KB. This is alaways occupied if BLE is enabled.

**Dynamic memory**

The size of BLE dynamic memory is defined in the project, named EXT\_COMMON\_MEMORY\_SIZE. User<br /> is able to change this size accordingly if necessary.

-   **Peripheral role only application:** **The basic data memory requirement is 14KB as below consideration**
    -   Use legacy Advertising
    -   Queued Tx buffer number is 4 for application payload
        -   The max application data size of each Tx packet is 247 byte
    -   One BLE connection only
    -   L2CAP CoC is not enable
-   **Central role only application:** **The basic data memory requirement is 14KB as below consideration**
    -   Use legacy Scan and Initiator
    -   Queued Tx buffer number is 4 for application payload
        -   The max application data size of each Tx packet is 247 byte
    -   One BLE connection only
    -   L2CAP CoC is not enable
-   **Both Peripheral and Central roles application:** **The basic data memory requirement is 16KB** **as below consideration**
    -   Use legacy Advertising, San and Initiator
    -   Queued Tx buffer number is 4 for application payload
        -   The max application data size of each Tx packet is 247 byte
    -   One BLE connections only
    -   L2CAP CoC is not enable
-   **Additional data memory requirement are counted for below consideration**
    -   Extended Advertising enable

        |578~731|3K|

    -   Extended Scan enable

        |733~976|3K+512|

    -   L2CAP CoC enable: 0.8K Bytes
    -   Need more queued Tx buffers for higher throughput consideration
        -   Add one more Tx buffer needs 264 byte. Max queued Tx buffer number is 12. Max additional data memory requirement for highest throughput is 264 \* \(12-4\) = 2104 byte
    -   Multi-link consideration
        -   Need 1120 byte for one more BLE connection. In order to support max to 6 BLE connections, additional 1120\* \(6-1\) = 5600 byte data memory are needed
    -   Periodic Advertising
