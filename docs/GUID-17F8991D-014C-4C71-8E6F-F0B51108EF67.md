# PTA Introduction

PIC32CXBZ3 provides the Three-Wire Packet Traffic Arbitration \(PTA\) WLAN coexistence<br /> solution.

This coexistence solution contains three pins that exchange coordinating information between<br /> BT and WLAN. When a BT request \(BT\_ACTIVE=1\) is received, the Wi-Fi device compares this<br /> external priority \(BT\_PRIORITY\) request against the internal Wi-Fi priority, and can choose to<br /> either grant BT \(WLAN\_ACTIVE=0\) or Wi-Fi \(WLAN\_ACTIVE=1\)

These three pins are defined as:

-   **BT\_ACTIVE**: This output pin describes when BT is using the RF resources. When the signal on it is high, it means BT is asking and accessing the RF; when the signal is low, BT is not using the RF.
-   **BT\_PRIORITY**: Comparing with **Time-shared** design, PIC32CXBZ3 is designed as **Static** output signal describes the priority of the BT request. When the signal on it is high, it represents a high-priority BT request; otherwise, it is a low-priority request. See Appendix 1 for both **Static**and **Time-shared** design concepts.
-   **WLAN\_ACTIVE**: This input pin brings in the information about when the WLAN activities are taking place. When the signal is high, it means a WLAN activity is using the RF resources; when the signal is low, WLAN is not using the RF.
