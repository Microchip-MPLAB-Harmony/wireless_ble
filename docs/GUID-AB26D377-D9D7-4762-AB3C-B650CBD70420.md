# Appendix 1: Two implementations of BT\_PRIORITY signal

<br />

-   **Static Priority Design**: It is either high or low during BT\_ACTIVE asserted for Tx or Rx operation.
-   **Time-Shared Priority Design**: It is either high or low for a typical 20 Âµs duration after BT\_ACTIVE asserted, but switches to low for Rx and high for Tx operation. See below diagram for both Static and Time-Shared BT\_PRIORITY design.
