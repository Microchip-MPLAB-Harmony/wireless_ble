# Concept of TX power control

-   The default RF TX power level is max TX power recorded in the OTP information block.

-   Application can get maximum and minimum factory RF TX power level by **[BLE\_GAP\_ReadFactoryTxPowerLevel](GUID-D2AF6178-DF0B-4C78-AAB0-CF237AD11F13.md)** API.

-   Application may give the RF TX Power preset values for Advertising or Connection Data physical channels by **[BLE\_GAP\_SetAdvTxPowerLevel](GUID-49F8A6C2-190C-4A66-9B87-1E9080DAACF7.md)** or **[BLE\_GAP\_SetConnTxPowerLevel](GUID-7448101D-2BC4-41C4-9D98-672806B90551.md)** APIs.

-   If BLE Stack Ext Adv module is enabled, Advertising PDU TX power setting for specific Advertising handle can be revised by **[BLE\_GAP\_SetExtAdvParams](GUID-5650922A-83B3-4561-BAA4-1D29B537AE04.md)** API.

-   If both connected LE devices support LE Power Control feature, RF TX power level will be adjusted by BLE stack within factory RF TX power range based on RF golden range automatically.
