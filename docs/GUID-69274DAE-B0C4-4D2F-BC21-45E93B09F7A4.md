# OTA Control Point Behavior

The OTA Control Point is used by a Client to control certain behaviors of the Server.

The procedures are triggered by writing a value that includes an Opcode specifying the<br /> operation and this may be followed by a Parameter that is valid within the context of<br /> that Opcode . For each of the procedures described in the next sections, the Server<br /> shall indicate the OTACP characteristic with the Response Code Opcode \(0x01\) along with<br /> the Request Opcode and â€œSuccessâ€? or other appropriate Result Code contained in the<br /> response as listed in [Table 4.2](GUID-F51ECE98-1134-4AC3-81B6-8740A8476F15.md).
